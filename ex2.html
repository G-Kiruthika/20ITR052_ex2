                <h3>KIA SELTOS</h3>
                <p>In terms of exterior looks, the Kia Seltos remains the same and has a very busy but unique front design. The chrome-finished signature tiger-nose grille is flanked by stylish pair of headlamps which are integrated with LED day-time-running lights. The horizontally stacked fog-lamps also look handsome. At the back, the well-appointed LED headlamps add to the muscular stance of Seltos. There’s chrome slat joining the tail lamps and the sculpted bumper with faux bash plates rounds off the Seltos’ exterior looks. Dimension wise, the Seltos measures 4315x1800x1620 mm with a wheelbase of 2610mm, a ground clearance of 190mm.
                 On the inside, along with the existing features like an electric sunroof, ambient lighting, leather seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, front ventilated seats, the mid-spec variants now receive add-ons such as
                     smart-key with remote engine start, new AI voice commands, electronic stability control, brake assist, and vehicle stability management. </p>

                <h3>HYUNDAI IONIQ 5</h3>
                <p>Based on the Electric Global Modular Architecture (E-GMP), the all-electric Ioniq 5 uses two different battery packs: 58kWh and 72.6kWh. The standard range battery pack provides a range of up to 385km, whereas the long-range one can cover up to 481km, as per WLTP. In addition, Hyundai offers a choice of two drivetrain options: rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive.
                   The base variant with a rear-wheel drive produces 168bhp and 350Nm of torque. On the other hand, the top-of-the-line all-wheel-drive trim can generate 301bhp and 605Nm of torque. Meanwhile, the top speed is rated at 185kmph.  
                    The Ioniq 5 uses a unique 800-volt charging architecture. When plugged into a 350kW ultra-fast charger, it can be charged 
                    from 10 to 80 per cent in just 18 minutes, while the charger also provides about 100km of range with five minutes of charge.</p>

              <h3>VOLVO XC90</h3>
              <p>The biggest update on the new XC90 is, of course, under its hood. Gone is the 235hp, 2.0-litre diesel engine; in comes the new 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbo-petrol unit 
                  that works in conjunction with a 48V integrated starter-generator motor. This engine produces 300hp and 420Nm of peak torque on the XC90, which is 65hp more powerful than the outgoing diesel version, but torque is down by 60Nm. The engine comes mated to an 8-speed torque converter automatic transmission with all-wheel drive being offered as standard. The XC90 also gets air suspension as standard fitment.
                Volvo also continues to offer the XC90 with a petrol plug-in hybrid powertrain that couples a 303hp, 2.0-litre petrol engine with an 87hp electric motor. 
                Positioned as the flagship model in Volvo India’s range, the XC90 Recharge retails in India for a price of Rs 96.65 lakh (ex-showroom, India).</p>
